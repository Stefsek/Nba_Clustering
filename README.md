## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

**Welcome to our third big blue data academy project</strong>!**

-In this project our idea was to take the data from a website and use clustering analysis.The data were extracted via webscrapping using python's beautiful soup.
K-means algorithm was used for clustering players attributes and as you can also see in our code and presentation the final outcome was very interesting
